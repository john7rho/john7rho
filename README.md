### Hey 👋 I'm John.🐺

I studied Statistics & Computer Science at Harvard. My interests have oscillated in college, but currently I am working at a startup focused on tech-enabling a traditional industry. 

For a (relatively) updated synopsis of my current work, please refer to my personal website at www.rhojohn.com.

In my free time, I enjoy running and reading. On any given day, you can find me ordering chai lattes (non-performatively) at a SF Blue Bottle.
